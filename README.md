# Data analysis project for the numerical ecology course (M2)

Macrobenthos sampling at 18 stations in Florida for 3 years.

Space-time model (coordinates + year) :
- can be simple (qualitative vars only)
- more complex with quantitative space (space-explicit) and time

-> Test space-time interaction

To-do :
- variation partitioning
- decompose beta diversity
- db-MEM
- clustering
- trajectory analysis (3 years)
